# implementations-for-Modern-C-Design
The book "Modern C++ Design" introduces many tools based on template meta-programming in cpp. I find these tools interesting and so does the template meta-programming.
This repo records my impl for these tools.  
As it's known to us, "Modern C++ Design" is not modern any more, so these impls are just for fun.
